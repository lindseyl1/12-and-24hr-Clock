# 12-and-24hr-Clock
This program uses C++ to prompt the user for their original time, displays that said time, as well as gives the user options to increase the hours, minutes, and seconds respectively. The time is shown in both 12hr and 24hr format.

This project was for the SNHU CS 210 Programming Languages course.

I went into it not very confident but luckily learned a lot! I feel as though I did very well on completing the instructions given to me, creating the manipulation and display of time.
