# 12-and-24hr-Clock
This program uses C++ to prompt the user for their original time, displays that said time, as well as gives the user options to increase the hours, minutes, and seconds respectively. The time is shown in both 12hr and 24hr format.

This project was for the SNHU CS 210 Programming Languages course.

I went into it not very confident but luckily learned a lot! I feel as though I did very well on completing the instructions given to me, creating the manipulation and display of time. The most challenging part was definitely the conversion of 12hr to 24hr format. Rhis required knowledge about the difference between the two, and the programming skills to convert it.

I wanted to keep this program as simple as possible, as to give the user a friendly, familiar setup. I will definitely take  a lot of things that I've learned with me, like validating inputs, utilizing if-else statements more, and widening my world knowledge for tasks such as converting 12hr formats to 24hr.
